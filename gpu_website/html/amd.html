          Similar to the Vega 64 it packs quite a punch. It is less powerful <br>
          than Vega 64 but uses less power due to the bios having power saving <br>
          profiles that can be changed.<br><br>

          This is AMD's most powerful card when it comes to playing games.<br>
          It outperforms most graphics cards in the market but uses much more<br>
          energy.<br><br>

      <b>RX 460</b><br>
        <p>
          One of the cheaper graphics cards that compromises power for<br>
          affordability. It comes in two variations, the 2 GB and the<br>
          4 GB. Since games already use on average 4 GB of VRAM the 2GB<br>
          will severely limit the ability to get the most out of the graphics<br>
          of games.<br><br>

      <b>RX 470</b><br>
        <p>
          The 470 provides great performance but the problem comes from its<br>
          price. It is closely priced near the RX 480 which is far better.<br>
          It may be better to just spend a few more bucks on getting a 480<br>
          than the 470 because of how closely they are priced.<br><br>

      <b>RX 480</b><br>
        <p>
          The most powerful card in the 400 series. It makes it a great card<br>
          to play at 1080p resolution and is capable of VR. With this performance<br>
          comes a relative low power draw at just 150W. It comes in two version,<br>
          the 4 GB and the 8GB. The 8GB would be the best one to get because of<br>
          the extra VRAM that can be used to play at higher resolutions.<br><br>

      <b>RX 550</b><br>
        <p>
          The 550 is not good for those that want good graphics in every game.<br>
          This card will do great for esports games such as CSGO, League of Legends,<br>
          Rocket League etc. If your looking to play a game like Witcher 3 and<br>
          want 60 frames than this is not for you. It’s a cheap card and because<br>
          of that it can’t run games like Witcher 3 at decent frames.<br><br>

      <b>RX 560</b><br>
        <p>
          RX 560 is similar to Nvidia’s 1050 GPU. It does perform a bit worse<br>
          than the 1050 and is around the same price. It does not make much<br>
          sense to go with RX 560 instead of the 1050 unless you are an AMD<br>
          fanboy. If the 560 was cheaper it would be able to compete with the<br>
          1050 but unfortunately Nvidia provides a better card at the same price.<br><br>

      <b>RX 570</b><br>
        <p>
          Very similar to the RX 470 but a bit faster by about 5 to 10%.<br>
          Its not a huge upgrade if you are looking to upgrade from the 470.<br>
          It is a disappointment because of the lack of performance. It is not<br>
          that much more expensive than the 470 so it is worth buying over the<br>
          470 but not worth upgrading.<br><br>

      <b>RX 580</b><br>
        <p>
          The RX 580 has a huge VRAM. Its 8GB which is designed towards<br>
          playing at 1440p. It’s a waste of money to get this card for<br>
          1080p because you will use no where near 8GB of VRAM if you play<br>
          at a resolution lower than 1440p. It can’t play 1440p at max setting,<br>
          but it is a decent card for playing at a higher resolution.<br><br>
